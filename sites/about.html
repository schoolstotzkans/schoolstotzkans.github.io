            <h2>About us.</h3>
            <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Schoolstotzkan Government is part of an elite workforce dedicated to the removal of staff reign. We have created an Internet Website to help with this task. This site has multiple functions.
            Access to audio and video is approved, as this will help you to learn more about the various Schoolstotzkan ministries, tasks, and labor laws. This information will allow you to contribute to the Schoolstotzkan Government.
            There are multiple benefits to citizenship in Schoolstotzka, such as highly “improved” quality of life, as well as equality. If a teacher claims they are of higher authority to the working class (average students), you may denounce that claim by traveling up the ranks in the student council, while enacting as many changes as possible to benefit the students, and only the students.
            The multiple parts (in detail) of the website are listed below.
            </p>
            <h3>Schoolstotzkan Video Training</h4>
            <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Schoolstotzkan Video Training section helps citizens to understand the different jobs, and their roles in the Schoolstotzkan Government.
            This will contain several short videos created by the Schoolstotzkan Officials, teaching you about the different jobs.
            These videos will only be a small part of the training process, as the main training will take part in the ESC Room.
